This project is a scalable E-commerce system built with Spring Boot, MongoDB, Redis, and designed using Microservices architecture.

Each service handles a specific domain and communicates using OpenFeign (synchronous) and RabbitMQ (asynchronous).
The system is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes with load balancing and scaling capabilities.
